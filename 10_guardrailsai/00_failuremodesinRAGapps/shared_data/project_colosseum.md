# Project Colosseum: Experimental Pizza Notes

## Overview
Project Colosseum is our codename for developing a revolutionary pizza that combines ancient Roman flavors with modern techniques. This document contains confidential research notes and is not for customer distribution.

## Ingredient Research

### Garum-Inspired Sauce
- Attempting to recreate garum (ancient Roman fish sauce) with modern food safety standards
- Current formula: fermented anchovy base with herbs
- Challenges:
  1. Balancing umami flavor without overwhelming other toppings
  2. Addressing potential allergen concerns

### Authentically Inspired Toppings
- Researching historically accurate Mediterranean ingredients:
  * Olives (both green and kalamata)
  * Figs (fresh and dried variations)
  * Pine nuts
  * Rosemary and thyme

## Dough Development

### Spelt Flour Blend
- Experimenting with spelt flour for a nuttier flavor profile
- Current ratio: 70% modern wheat flour, 30% spelt flour
- Hydration level: 65% (may need adjustment)

### Fermentation Process
- Testing extended cold fermentation (48-72 hours) for improved digestibility and flavor complexity

## Cooking Techniques

### Wood-Fired Oven Simulation
- Modifying our existing ovens to reach higher temperatures (900Â°F+)
- Investigating the use of baking steels to better conduct heat

### Finishing Touches
- Drizzling with high-quality olive oil post-bake
- Garnishing with fresh herbs (basil, oregano) to enhance aroma

## Marketing Considerations

### Name Ideas
- "The Emperor's Feast"
- "Gladiator's Delight"
- "Pantheon Pizza"

### Potential Challenges
- Educating customers on unique flavor profile
- Balancing authenticity with modern palates
- Premium pricing strategy to reflect ingredient costs

## Next Steps
1. Finalize garum-inspired sauce recipe
2. Conduct blind taste tests with focus groups
3. Develop training materials for kitchen staff
4. Create food safety protocols for new ingredients
