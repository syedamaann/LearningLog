## some common failure modes in RAG applications

1. hallucinations due to model limitations
2. going off topic or unintended app use like using a customer support bot for programming queries
3. revealing or mishandling PII ie. personal identifiable information
4. competitor mentions that cause reputational damage

## how to solve?

these methods help solve it a little bit: 

1. better retrieval for RAG apps
2. better prompting, better prompt engineering
3. better models or model finetuning


this method help solve it a bit more: **AI validation via better Guardrails**
