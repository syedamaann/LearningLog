- User accesses a web application built with Flask to upload data.
- The web application presents a form with an option to upload CSV files or input data directly.
- The user selects a CSV file containing input data for the machine learning model.
- Upon submission, the Flask application receives the file through a POST request.
- Flask creates a `Request` object that encapsulates the data, including the uploaded file.
- The uploaded file is accessed via `request.files` as a `FileStorage` object.
- The `FileStorage` object contains metadata such as the filename and content type.
- The file content is read into memory, allowing for quick processing.
- If needed, the uploaded file can be saved to a specified directory on the server using the `save()` method.
- The application processes the data using a pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., from scikit-learn or TensorFlow).
- The processed data is passed to the model to generate predictions or insights.
- The predictions or insights are formatted and sent back to the front end of the web application.
- The results are displayed to the user on the web page.
- Optionally, visualizations of the data or predictions are generated using libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly.
- Users can review the output and, if desired, upload new data for further predictions.
- The application allows users to interactively explore and utilize machine learning predictions through a user-friendly web interface.
