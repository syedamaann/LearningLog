Federated learning allows us to train machine learning models across decentralized data sources while maintaining data privacy.

First, I import necessary packages, including Flower for federated learning, dataset handling utilities, and differential privacy strategies. The configuration settings are loaded, and we filter out unnecessary warnings for a cleaner output. Then, set up dataset partitioning using IID partitioning, to make sure each client gets a fair share of data. next, visualize these partitions to understand how the data is distributed among clients.

Now, let's configure the client and server for the federated learning process. For the client, we load the tokenizer, data collator, and prompt formatting function, then define the client application using these components, specifying a save path for the model. On the server side, define a function that uses the FedAvg strategy with added differential privacy, ensuring privacy-preserving model updates. instantiate the server application with this strategy. Now it's time to run the simulation, which takes a bit of time, then evaluate the fine-tuned model using specific data points, comparing the modelâ€™s output with expected responses. finally, visualize the results and analyze communication costs to understand the efficiency of the federated learning process.
