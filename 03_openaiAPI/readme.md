This project sets up a customer service assistant using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o-mini model to handle user queries about products. It first checks user input with OpenAI's Moderation API to filter out inappropriate content. If the input passes, it extracts relevant product information from a utility module, generates a response based on the product details, and then verifies the response with the Moderation API again. Finally, the response is assessed for its relevance to the initial query before delivering it to the user.

The setup includes a Panel-based GUI for real-time interaction. Users input their questions via a text field, and responses are displayed in a conversation format. The interface handles user input, processes it to generate a response, and updates the display with both user queries and assistant responses. This setup ensures that users receive accurate, helpful information in a friendly, interactive environment.
