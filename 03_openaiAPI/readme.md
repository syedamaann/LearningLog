This project sets up a customer service assistant using OpenAI’s GPT-4o-mini model to handle user queries about products. It first checks user input with OpenAI's Moderation API to filter out inappropriate content. If the input passes, it extracts relevant product information from a utility module, generates a response based on the product details, and then verifies the response with the Moderation API again. Finally, the response is assessed for its relevance to the initial query before delivering it to the user.

The setup includes a Panel-based GUI for real-time interaction. Users input their questions via a text field, and responses are displayed in a conversation format. The interface handles user input, processes it to generate a response, and updates the display with both user queries and assistant responses. This setup ensures that users receive accurate, helpful information in a friendly, interactive environment.





raw flowing thoughts: 

Orderbot was a simple project yet profound in the sense that it taught me to think about customer problems that can be solved simply. It makes me think about what other problems can be made easier by creating a chatbot. The process isn’t concrete, but the inception is clear in my mind: start with the user journey, be out there in the market, and spend time living the user journey and with people who are living the user journey. Note the intricate details and variations in the user journey, map the variations and details, mark the pain points and common points of dissatisfaction, and then write effective prompts that can guide the user step by step to the solution. This is simple but profound.

Let’s talk with an example: last year I was at the Flipkart internal hackathon to solve the problems in acquiring elderly people for Flipkart HealthPlus. If I were to do the same hackathon today, I would have gone to the old age home, stayed there for two days, learned their life, and lived their life. I would note their problems and then build a chatbot tailored to their user journey and pain points. Then, I would move back to the Flipkart HQ and build a chatbot to solve their problem. This would lead me to redesign the entire app flow to cater to different user segments, including elderly people. This can seriously make the app more centric to different user groups and align with their needs. It’s a fun thing to think about. That is why Orderbot is a simple yet profound project, for it showed me that simple solutions can be great. You don’t really need to over-complicate solutions; just a well-designed chatbot flow can revamp the UX flow for the better. That’s interesting and exciting.

Generating customer service emails seems like a very straightforward project, and if implemented correctly, this has many use cases across industries. Any situation where there is an inflow of reviews or any form of user-generated content, we can qualitatively understand the problems, categorize those problems, pipe the problems in each category to relevant microservices that have the entire user experience flow on how to handle that specific categorized problem, and based on those handling scenarios, send out crafted custom emails. Instead of generic “sorry for the inconvenience, we will solve it” emails, you can craft a better email where you actually solve or partially solve the problem or at least show the steps you will take to solve the problem and send them almost real-time response emails. How amazing would that be if we are able to implement it correctly?

We know this, but it’s often not top of mind that ChatGPT can translate between formats. The prompt should describe the input and output formats, that’s it. Think how useful that is in making data pipelines. You can convert data from CSV to JSON, JSON to HTML, HTML to LaTeX, or SQL or even Python or whatnot. This eliminates format being any kind of bottleneck in moving data across pipes. That seems promising, though I'm not sure how reliable such a GPT-orchestrated system would be. This would raise some obvious privacy and single-point failure concerns. The point is to always think about what the current user journey is and how improved the user journey is after our proposed changes. Haha, let’s see. Thinking is good, either way.

These systems are good at inferring. They can infer emotions: positive, negative, happy, sad, anger, influenced or influenced, malice, or innocence. What is possible when you can accurately know emotions? You can use it to swing elections, manipulate the populace, and all sorts of negative things. Or you can use it to apply expert psychologists and partner with them to craft amazing prompts to treat people vulnerable to self-harm, to people suffering from loneliness, to make old people feel loved, to counsel criminals in a regulated environment, to teach students better by catering to their emotions at every point, and to help infer bad thoughts and prevent wrong actions. It is an exciting thought and it is a thought that can make anything possible by correctly inferring emotions. That is powerful.

Okay, so we can use chain of thought (giving GPT a step-by-step procedure to follow) and chaining of prompts (chaining one GPT response to another in a way to carry out a complex procedure). The final one in this chain of prompts can be a prompt to evaluate the previous one’s performance on how well they executed the task given in their prompts. It’s a simple flow of things. Writing the prompts to carry out the exact tasks we need could possibly be a tricky area, but there are so many good prompts that can be used to plug and play. Mainly, this course itself has some really good prompts, especially for evaluations. Things look straightforward and nice if we can manage to get the prompts right!

The one thing that still bothers me is how all this is connected to the front end. It would be interesting and empowering to know the complete setup of things from the brimming front to the deepest back. I will probably learn a bit about Nginx, APIs, microservices, MLOps, etc., to know exactly how everything is connected to the frontend and being served out in the world. Yo, nice.
