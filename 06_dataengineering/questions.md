**Regulatory Constraints**
You are working with a healthcare company that must comply with HIPAA regulations. How would you choose between an on-premises and cloud-based data architecture in this scenario? What security measures would influence your decision?

**Monolithic Migration**
Imagine you inherit a legacy monolithic ETL pipeline that is slow and prone to failure, delaying downstream processes. How would you approach transitioning from this monolithic architecture to a more modular or microservices-based system? What technologies would you consider for the migration?

**Cost vs. Performance**
You’re tasked with designing a data pipeline for a startup with tight budgets but potentially massive growth in data volume. How would you balance the need for low upfront costs with future scalability? Would you recommend a cloud-based OpEx approach or investing in on-premises hardware?

**Vendor Lock-In**
Your company has been heavily reliant on AWS services, but due to new leadership, there’s a push for a multi-cloud strategy. How would you architect a data system that avoids vendor lock-in while maintaining performance and efficiency? What trade-offs would you expect?

**Data Processing Speed**
You are building a data processing pipeline where near-real-time insights are crucial for business decisions. How would you architect this pipeline, and which tools would you prioritize for minimizing latency while still considering scalability and cost?
